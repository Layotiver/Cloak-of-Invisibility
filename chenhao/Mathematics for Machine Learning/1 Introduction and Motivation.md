# 1 Introduction and Motivation
- four pillars of machine learning:
1. regression
2. dimensonality reduction
3. density estimation
4. classificaiton

- Mathematics
1. linear algebra: the study of vectors and matrices
2. analytic geometry: the construction of similarity and distances
3. matrix decomposition: an intuitive interpretation of the data and more efficient learning
4. probability theory: quantification of uncertainty
5. vector calculus: the concept of gradients
